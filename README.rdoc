== STEPCLICK

StepClick is simple video analysis web app. Users can upload videos which are processed by ffmpeg into image sequences. The image sequences are then available to be scaled using real units (by measuring on screen) and the motion of objects analyzed. 

The current version only supports tracking of one object.
